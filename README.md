# Walmart-Sales-Prediction-Using-Multiple-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
# Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting Walmart sales based on various features such as store information, holiday events, and other relevant factors. The project applies multiple machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to predict future sales trends.

Accurate sales prediction is crucial for inventory management, financial planning, and ensuring product availability, especially during peak times and holidays. Among the models tested, the Random Forest algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy and was the most effective for predicting sales.

# Algorithms Used

Naive Bayes: A simple, probabilistic classifier.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric method used for classification and regression.

Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and outputs the most common result.

Decision Tree: A model that makes predictions based on decisions split by features.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised learning model for classification and regression tasks.
# Best Performing Algorithm:
   Random Forest was the most accurate model, outperforming other algorithms in predicting Walmart's sales data, making it the ideal choice for this task.
# Dataset Overview
The dataset contains various features related to Walmart stores, such as sales data across multiple departments, store locations, holiday dates, and weekly sales figures. The goal is to predict future sales based on these inputs.

# Features: Store IDs, departments, dates, sales figures, holiday events, etc.
# Target: Weekly sales for each store and department.
